Game of Life by Natalie Stiegemeier

Instructions:

This game is similar to Conway's Game of Life. You can run it by executing the jar file. 
Once you hit run, there are four buttons that can be selected. The "Go" button allows the game to start, 
and the "Load" button allows the user to load a new scenario. This will open a file dialog box and 
you can select the file "NEW SENARIO" to start a new senario. The other two buttons "Sort R" and "Sort C" 
sort the specimens by row and column.
